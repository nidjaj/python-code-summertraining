write the program that will do
  i)  print only those numbers greater than 5
  ii)  also print those numbers those are less than or  equals to 2  ( <= 2 )
  iii)  store these answers in in two different list also
Solution 
adhoc=[1,2,3,1,4,5,66,22,2,6,0,9]
x=[i for i in adhoc if i >5]
print(x)
y=[i for i in adhoc if i <=2]
print(y)
